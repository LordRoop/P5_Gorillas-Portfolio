# Website
Hello, World! This is our website, which consists of a project link to our previous project of 3x3 and 4x4 Tic Tac Toe, the CSP class resources (Nighthawk Coding Society Padlet), and our project plan.  
# Purpose
* Make our projects and resources accesible to other students and teachers.
* add a simple and stylish UI for those who want to view our project

# This Week

* This week we worked more on understanding how to port our code from repl.it into IntelliJ IDEA. And we are proud to say we now are almost complete "pros" at that. We also worked together to make a more reliable server machine. For that we used a Raspberry Pi. We can now constantly run our website without having to have our own machine awake all the time. this was a major achievement for us because now there is less stuff to worry about.
* We also worked on making the website easily accessible for those outside the host's residence by opening a port of entrance on our router.
