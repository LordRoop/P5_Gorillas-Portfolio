# The Groop READ.ME file

# Website
Hello, World! This is our website, which consists of a project link to our previous project of 3x3 and 4x4 Tic Tac Toe, the CSP class resources (Nighthawk Coding Society Padlet), and our project plan.  

# Purpose
* Make our projects and resources accesible to other students and teachers.
* add a simple and stylish UI for those who want to view our project

# Individual Code for Week 7
* This week we fully incorporated the Raspberry Pi, we updated our README.md, we learned the ins and outs of "Repl.it to IntelliJ process" and one of outr group members even made a video for the class explaining how to port their project to IntelliJ easily.
* We did not really work on code this week
* Instead we focused on our README.md, porting the Repl.it to the IntelliJ, and incorporating the Raspberry Pi into our project
* Next week we plan to improve our code
* We were a little bit unlucky on the grading criteria for this week, since what we did is not viewable to the consumer, it is more behind the scenes work.

# This Week
* This week we worked more on understanding how to port our code from repl.it into IntelliJ IDEA. And we are proud to say we now are almost complete "pros" at that. We also worked together to make a more reliable server machine. For that we used a Raspberry Pi. We can now constantly run our website without having to have our own machine awake all the time. this was a major achievement for us because now there is less stuff to worry about.
* We also worked on making the website easily accessible for those outside the host's residence by opening a port of entrance on our router.
* We did not work on code as much this week, since we wanted to have our website up and  running reliably before we started doing anything related to the main coding of the website


# The Future
* This next week we plan on increasing the functionality of our website
* We plan on making a menu tab in which the user can easily navigate the website
