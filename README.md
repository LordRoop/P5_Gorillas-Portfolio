## Self Evaluation

| Name | Self Evaluation | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Arul | 10/10 | I believe I was a very good group contributor this week. I was very vocal and collaborative with my group, always trying to not only stay productive, but also work together to minimize individual work. First, to start the week, I downloaded the necessary applications needed to complete this assignment. I was responsible for contributing to the creation of the website by helping select a background through VANTA, that was both subtle and interactive. Additionally, I helped make sure our group remained on task and helped start this plan. |
|  Manuel | 10/10 | I believe that I was an exceedingly good teammate this week, I was talking to my group and always asking what more I could do to help, I stayed on task the majority of the time and I was always learning about how to do things that my more advanced group member knew how to do. I also downloaded the necessary applications for this project and I helped in the creation of a new website and helped our group pick a cool new background for our website that moves when your mouse hovers over it using VANTA which is pretty cool to see. |
|  Colin | 10/10 | I think I got a 10/10 on this week because I remained on task the whole time and I downloaded intelliJ as well as other applications that I needed to get in order to help my group with our website. I am learning how websites work and how to make one myself which is very interesting. I also helped my group pick out a background of a globe that moves for our website using VANTA. |
|  Pedro | 10/10 | I belive I got a 10/10. I was the first to finish downloading IntelliJ this week, so I began working on the site early. I set up the code based on the example provided to us. I then figured out how the buttons work and linked all of our resources to our Website through the buttons. I also spent a lot of time helping Roop learn how to use vanta, and get our new background working. We had a little bit of trouble getting the background to display, but we figured it out in the end.  |
|  Roop | 10/10 | I got a 10 out of 10 this week. I downloaded the IntelliJ IDEA and Git. Then I helped Manuel download his on his Mac. I helped with the Repl.it, spending a while breaking, and then fixing the website background with Pedro's help. I learned how to use VANTA Backgrounds. It was really interesting. I helped choose the background we wound up using.  |
